#### **东北大学嵌入式系统实验室（ESlab group）**

Welcome to my homepage! I am currently working at Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing in Medical Image as a Tenure Track Assistant Professor in Northeastern University, China. I created this website to share the output of my studies and be reachable.

I graduated from College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University with a bachelor’s and master’s degree and from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University with a doctor’s degree, advised by Professor Wang Yi (王义) and Nan Guan (关楠). Between 2020 and 2021, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

My primary research interests lie within embedded systems, recently pivoting towards Autonomous Driving and Real-Time Robotic Operating Systems (ROS), as well as Batteryless Energy-Harvesting Systems. In collaboration with my research partners, we delve into operating systems and runtimes, intermittent computing, and trustworthy, real-time edge AI, with a specialized focus on autonomous driving.
