#### **智能感知交互实验室（Intelligent Interaction Laboratory）**

In 2019, it was initiated and established by Professor Xu Tao. The long-term goal of the laboratory is to understand the intelligent information processing mechanism and cognitive process of the human brain, and provide new computing structures and algorithms for information technology. Use advanced EEG equipment and system modeling technology to study new human-computer interaction computing models and algorithms. The current research directions of interest include brain-computer interface, computer vision, graph neural network, bioinformatics, etc.
